The Nearby Connections API enables your app to easily discover other devices on a local network and connect to each other and exchange messages in real-time. This functionality is especially useful for two types of user experiences:

Local multiplayer gaming: Allows one player to set up a local multiplayer game and let other players on the network join it. Your app can also allow a player to start an in-game mission when enough nearby participants join.
Multi-screen gaming: Allows players to use their phone or tablet as a game controller to play games displayed on a nearby large-screen Android device, such as Android TV. Your app can also enable players to see a customized game screen on their personal device while all nearby participants see a shared common view on a table-top Android device.
